One of the things I love most about teaching is that it’s a two-way street. While I teach, I also learn — about my students, about life, and sometimes, about myself. Every day brings something new, and yesterday reminded me of a lesson I’ll never forget.

There’s a pupil in my class with special needs. She rarely talks. She often sits alone and doesn't have friends to play or chat with. I’ve always made sure she has a comfortable seat, and I regularly remind the others not to bully her or leave her out.

She usually appears lost in her own world — silent, distant. But yesterday, something changed.

While going around the class during an English lesson, I noticed she was drawing instead of writing. I was just about to correct her, but then I looked closer. It was a drawing of a **human skeleton** — detailed, well-structured, and clearly thoughtful. I was shocked.

The science teacher had taught them about the skeleton just the day before. While I had assumed she wasn’t paying attention, she had absorbed everything — and expressed it in a way that came naturally to her.

In that moment, I felt emotional. It hit me hard: **she is not incapable — she just expresses herself differently.**

That drawing reminded me that **every child has a gift**. Sometimes it’s buried deep beneath silence or behavior we don’t understand. But with **patience, protection, and the right guidance**, that gift can grow and shine.

As teachers, parents, or even community members, our job is not just to teach but to **look closely, listen deeply, and believe fiercely** — even when the world doesn’t.

Because sometimes, all a child needs is for *someone* to see them.
